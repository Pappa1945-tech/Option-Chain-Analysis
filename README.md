# Option-Chain-Analysis
Options Analyzer
A real-time web application for analyzing Nifty and BankNifty options, providing support/resistance levels, Put-Call Ratio (PCR) analysis, trend indicators, and trading signals. Built with Python, Flask, SocketIO, and Pandas, it leverages NSE option chain data to deliver actionable insights for traders.
Project Overview
Options Analyzer is a robust tool for options traders, fetching real-time Nifty and BankNifty option chain data from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) via the nsepython library. It processes this data to compute key metrics and visualizes results through an interactive web interface. Key features include:

Support/Resistance Levels: Identifies critical price points using open interest (OI) and volume.
PCR Analysis: Calculates Put-Call Ratios to assess market sentiment.
Trend Indicators: Quantifies bullish/bearish trends based on PCR and Last Traded Price (LTP).
Trading Signals: Generates real-time buy/sell signals for specific strike prices.
Strike Price Analysis: Provides detailed historical and real-time data for selected strikes.

This project showcases advanced Python skills, real-time data processing, and web development, making it a strong portfolio piece for a Python developer role.
Features

Real-Time Data: Fetches and processes NSE option chain data every second using multithreading.
Interactive UI: Flask and SocketIO enable dynamic, real-time updates.
Advanced Analytics:
Support/resistance based on OI and volume.
PCR metrics with hybrid averages (simple moving to rolling mean).
Trend strength (0–100 scale) using LTP and PCR.
Signals driven by straddle LTP, implied volatility (IV), and trends.


Robustness: Comprehensive error handling and logging.
Security: Google Drive-based password authentication.
Monitoring: Real-time connection status updates.

Workflow

Initialization:

app.py launches Flask and SocketIO.
run_option_chain_fetchers() authenticates via Google Drive.
glob_var.py initializes state variables.


Data Fetching:

fetch_nifty_oc() and fetch_banknifty_oc() retrieve option chain data.
Filters strikes (±20 from ATM) and adds computed columns (e.g., PCR_OI, straddleLtp).


Data Processing:

calculate_pcr_data() computes PCR metrics with hybrid averages.
find_sup_resis() determines support/resistance levels.
give_signals() generates trading signals.
get_strike_price() fetches strike-specific data.


Real-Time Updates:

background_thread() updates data every 5 seconds.
SocketIO emits events for expiry, trends, signals, strikes, support/resistance, and PCR charts.


Frontend:

Templates render static content.
SocketIO updates UI with real-time data.



Dataflow

Input:

NSE option chain data via nsepython.
User-selected strike prices via SocketIO.


Processing:

Stores raw data in nifty_mother_list and banknifty_mother_list.
Computes metrics (PCR, signals, support/resistance) stored in glob_var.
Applies hybrid averages for trend smoothing.


Output:

Emits data to frontend via SocketIO for:
Support/resistance levels
PCR charts
Trend indicators
Trading signals
Strike analytics (LTP, IV, bid/ask)
